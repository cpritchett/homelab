# Rationale
This repo exists to reduce operational entropy and help AI agents operate safely.

The goal is higher uptime and lower surprise by:
- encoding intent in DNS
- gating external access through identity
- preserving a boring, isolated management plane
- documenting decisions and risks explicitly
