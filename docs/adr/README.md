# ADRs
Architectural Decision Records explain *why* decisions were made.

## Status values
- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded
- Deprecated

## Rules
- ADRs are append-only history.
- If reversing a decision, add a new ADR that supersedes the old one.
- ADRs should link to relevant specs in `requirements/` where appropriate.
